# Python and R Comparison

This is a series of working notes that document the comparisons between R and Python for some common tasks in the data science area. 

Here are the topics so far (*work in progress*):

- `data_analysis`: data analysis and summary using Python's `Pandas` and R's `tidyverse`
- `ml_classification`: machine learning classification using Python's `sklearn` and R's `caret`
